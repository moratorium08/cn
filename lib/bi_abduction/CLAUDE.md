# Bi-Abduction Inference Framework

## What this is

OCaml inference framework for bi-abductive specification inference in CN/Fulminate.
Takes runtime data (missing ownership addresses + heap dumps) from Phase 1 (C runtime
in `runtime/libcn/src/cn-executable/bi_abduction.c`) and suggests CN specifications.

Pipeline: **parse → group by function → build memory graph → enumerate qualifiers → compute footprints → disjoint set cover → pretty-print suggestions**.

Entry points:
- Push-button CLI: `bin/bi_abd_infer.ml` (`cn bi-abd file.c` — instruments, compiles, runs, infers)
- Library: `Bi_abduction.Infer.infer_from_files` (just the inference, given pre-collected data)

## Module map

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `data_point.ml` | Parse `cn_abd_summary.json` (lightweight: missing addrs + var bindings) and `cn_abd_heap.jsonl` (raw memory words). Types: `var_binding`, `missing_entry`, `data_point`, `heap_dump`. |
| `memory_graph.ml` | Build a directed graph from heap data. Nodes = addresses, edges = struct field offsets or pointer dereferences. BFS from anchors (function args) through pointer-sized fields to discover linked structures. |
| `qualifier.ml` | Thin wrapper around `Request.t`. A qualifier = a candidate `take _ = ...` binding. Uses CN's existing `Request.t`, `IndexTerms.t`, `Sctypes.t` — no parallel type hierarchy. |
| `enumerator.ml` | Generate candidate qualifiers: `Owned<struct_type>(ptr)` for each pointer arg × struct type, plus `Pred(ptr)` for each recursive predicate whose pointer connects to missing addresses in the graph. |
| `footprint.ml` | Compute which byte-addresses a qualifier covers. `Owned` → `[base, base+size)`. Predicates → `reachable_struct_bytes` from the memory graph. |
| `cover.ml` | Disjoint set cover: pick minimal qualifier subset covering all missing addresses. Exact (all subsets) for ≤20 candidates, greedy otherwise. |
| `infer.ml` | Top-level orchestrator. Picks best representative data point, wires everything together, formats output. |

## Key design decisions

- **Reuse CN types** — qualifiers are `Request.t`, terms are `IndexTerms.t`. No separate AST.
- **Byte-level granularity** — the runtime records missing addresses per-byte. Footprints must also be per-byte. `owned_footprint` strides by 1, not 8.
- **BFS graph expansion** — the memory graph follows pointer chains through intermediate nodes (e.g. n2 in `p→n1→n2→n3`) that aren't themselves missing. Without this, linked structure inference doesn't work.
- **Representative data point** — for recursive functions, base cases (e.g. `t=NULL`) have empty missing sets. We pick the data point with the most missing addresses.
- **Struct byte expansion** — `reachable_struct_bytes` expands struct base addresses to full `[base, base+struct_total_size)` byte ranges. This bridges the gap between graph-level nodes and byte-level missing sets.

## CN/Cerberus conventions to know

- CN's `List`, `Option`, `String` modules shadow `Stdlib`. Always use `module StdList = Stdlib.List` etc.
- `BaseTypes.t = unit t_gen` so `Loc` carries `unit`: `Loc ()`. Surface `BaseTypes.Surface.t = Sctypes.t option t_gen` has `Loc (Some ct)`. Don't mix them.
- `Pp.debug level (lazy doc)` prints to stderr when `-p level` is ≥ the given level. Use levels 2–5 for inference debug output.
- `Cerb_colour.without_colour` has type `(unit -> 'a) -> unit -> 'a` (curried). You must apply the trailing `()`.
- `<>` is shadowed by CN's integer comparison. Use `String.length s > 0` instead of `s <> ""` for string checks.
- `Request.t` does not support polymorphic `=`. Pattern match instead of `x = []`.

## Runtime data format

**`cn_abd_summary.json`** — written once at exit:
```json
{"version":1,"data_points":[{
  "function":"f",
  "pre":{"vars":[{"name":"p","value":"0x...","size":8,"type":"pointer"}],
         "missing":[{"addr":"0x...","size":1}]},
  "post":{"vars":[],"missing":[...]}
}]}
```

**`cn_abd_heap.jsonl`** — one JSON object per line, written incrementally:
```json
{"function":"f","addr":"0x...","words":{"0x...":"0x...",...}}
```
Words are 8-byte-aligned address → 8-byte hex value. Used by `heap_lookup` for pointer chasing.

## Debug output (`-p N`)

The inference modules use `Pp.debug` at these levels:
- **2**: High-level pipeline stages (parsing, per-function inference start/end)
- **3**: Data point details (vars, missing counts, representative selection)
- **4**: Graph construction (nodes, edges, BFS expansion), enumeration results
- **5**: Footprint computation per qualifier, cover algorithm steps

## Known limitations / TODOs

See **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** for detailed analysis. The most critical:

- **Only postconditions are inferred** — `body_missing` captures all body ownership failures, which conflates precondition and postcondition needs
- **Multiple executions break inference** — `must_cover_set` unions addresses from different calls; `exact_cover` only tracks complete covers
- **No partial spec awareness** — suggested qualifiers may overlap with existing takes
- **No iterated resources, free/malloc, loop invariants, qualifier chains, return value**

## Testing

```bash
# Curated bi-abduction regression suite
tests/run-bi-abd.sh

# Simple struct (Owned inference)
cn bi-abd tests/bi-abd/simple_struct_nospec.c

# Linked list (recursive predicate inference)
cn bi-abd tests/bi-abd/list_example_nospec.c

# Binary tree (recursive predicate inference)
cn bi-abd tests/bi-abd/tree_example_nospec.c
```

In development, set `CN_RUNTIME_PREFIX` to a directory containing `include/` and `libcn_exec.a`.
